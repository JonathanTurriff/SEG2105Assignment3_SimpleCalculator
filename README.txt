Name: Jonathan Turriff
Class: SEG 2105
Professor: Timothy Lethbridge

In this assignement, I had to make a simple calculator using Android Studios.
This taught me how to set event handlers for buttons and the textview but also taught me how to install
a AVM to be able to run my code (The hardest part).
